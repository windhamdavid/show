# Show

A place for slide presentations which allows me to control the slides on every device so that attendees can view on their own screens alongside of the projector. Particularly helpful for readability and viewing image details while the audience or class is left with ability to access the slides at later on. I strongly recommend removing the slide navigation from the screen so that the viewers are not tempted to advance to the next slide.
